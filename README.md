# Pong-Game
It is a JavaScript based game with an AI 2nd player, created to understand on how to implement game-login in JavaScript. You can play this game [here!](https://samardeep-kajal.github.io/Pong-Game/)  <br /> 
Special shout-out to the youtube channel called "Web dev simplified", which helped me to think about the mechanics behind the game in JavaScript.
